## Introduction

A comprehensive description of data is pivotal for conducting insightful explanatory and exploratory analyses. This episode focuses on describing and visualizing epidemic data. The examples are built around the **Covid-19 case data from England** dataset that is part of the [{outbreaks}](http://www.reconverse.org/outbreaks/) package. The initial step consists in reading this dataset, and we recommend utilizing the [{readr}](../links.md#readr) package for this purpose (or employing alternative methods as outlined in the [Read case data](../episodes/read-cases.Rmd)).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
covid19_eng_case_data <- outbreaks::covid19_england_nhscalls_2020
head(covid19_eng_case_data)
```

## Incidence cases

Downstream analysis involves working with aggregated data rather than individual cases. The  [{incidence2}]((https://www.reconverse.org/incidence2/articles/incidence2.html){.external target="_blank"}) package offers essential functionalities for grouping case data, usually centered around dated occurrences and/or other factors. The code chunk provided below demonstrates the creation of an `incidence2` object from the `covid19_eng_case_data` based on the date of sample.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
covid19_eng_incidence_data <- incidence(
  covid19_eng_case_data,
  date_index = "date"
)
head(covid19_eng_incidence_data)
```

The `incidence2` object can be visualized using the `plot()` function from base R package. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot(covid19_eng_incidence_data)
```

Moreover, {incidence2} has functionalities that allow for aggregating case data based on a dated event and other factors such as the individual gender, the sampling location, etc. In the example below, we calculate weekly counts of Covid-19 cases in England grouping them by `sex` type.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
weekly_covid19_eng_incidence <- incidence2::incidence(
  covid19_eng_case_data,
  date_index = "date",
  interval = "week",
  groups = "sex"
)
plot(weekly_covid19_eng_incidence, angle = 45)
```
A comprehensive description of data is pivotal for conducting insightful explanatory and exploratory analyses. This episode focuses describing and visualizing epidemic data, with a particular focus on a **Covid-19 case data from England**, which comes with the [outbreaks](http://www.reconverse.org/outbreaks/) package. The initial step involves reading this dataset, and we recommend utilizing the [readr](../links.md#readr) package for this purpose (or employing alternative methods as outlined in the [Read case data](../episodes/read-cases.Rmd)).

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
requireNamespace("outbreaks")
covid19_eng_case_data <- outbreaks::covid19_england_nhscalls_2020
utils::head(covid19_eng_case_data, 5)
```


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

- Using the above `covid91_eng_case_data`  dataset, produce monthly epi-curves for Covid-19 cases in England based on regional places in England?

#### Analyzing the trend in case data

Aggregated case data over a specific time unit, or incidence data, typically represent the number of cases occurring within that time frame. These data can often be assumed to follow either a **Poisson** or a **negative binomial** distribution, depending on the specific characteristics of the data and the underlying processes generating them.

When analyzing such data, one common approach is to examine the trend over time by computing the **rate of change**, which can indicate whether there is exponential growth or decay in the number of cases. Exponential growth implies that the number of cases is increasing at an accelerating rate over time, while exponential decay suggests that the number of cases is decreasing at a decelerating rate.

Understanding the trend in case data is crucial for various purposes, such as forecasting future case counts, implementing public health interventions, and assessing the effectiveness of control measures. By analyzing the trend, policymakers and public health experts can make informed decisions to mitigate the spread of diseases and protect public health.

The {i2extras} package provides methods for modelling the trend in case data, calculating moving averages, and exponential growth or decay rate. The code chunk below computes the Covid-19 trend in UK within first 3 months using a negative binomial distribution. 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# subset the covid19_eng_case_data to include only the first 3 months of data.
df <- subset(covid19_eng_case_data,
             covid19_eng_case_data$date <= min(covid19_eng_case_data$date) + 90)

# compute the incidence data, grouping it by sex.
df_incid <- incidence2::incidence(df, date_index = "date", groups = "sex")

# use the fit_curve function from i2extras to fit a curve to the incidence data
fitted_curve <- i2extras::fit_curve(df_incid, model  = "negbin", alpha = 0.05)

# plot the fitted curve
plot(fitted_curve, angle = 45)
```

# This line loads the i2extras package, which  provides methods for modeling

df <- base::subset(covid19_eng_case_data,
                   covid19_eng_case_data$date <= min(covid19_eng_case_data$date)
                   + 90)

fitted_curve <-
  i2extras::fit_curve(df_incid, model  = "negbin", alpha = 0.05)
# Here, the fit_curve function from i2extras
# is used to fit a curve to the incidence data.
# The model chosen is the negative binomial distribution
# with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05.
base::plot(fitted_curve, angle = 45) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Date", y = "Cases")
```
The rate of exponential growth or decay can be extracted from the fitted curve via `growth_rate` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
rates <- i2extras::growth_rate(fitted_curve)
rates <- base::as.data.frame(rates)
rates %>% select(sex, r, r_lower, r_upper)
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A moving average, which shows the trend of cases in specified time period, also can be calculate using the `add_rolling_average` function in `i2extras` package, as illustrated in the below code chunk.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
moving_Avg <- i2extras::add_rolling_average(df_incid, n = 7L)
base::plot(moving_Avg, border_colour = "white", angle = 45) +

base::plot(fitted_curve, angle = 45) + ggplot2::labs(x = "Date", y = "Cases")
```

### Exponential growth or decay rate

The rate of exponential growth or decay can be extracted from the fitted curve via the `growth_rate()` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rates <- i2extras::growth_rate(fitted_curve)
rates <- base::as.data.frame(rates) %>%
  subset(select = c(sex, r, r_lower, r_upper))
```

### Peak time

The **Peak time ** is the date which the highest number of cases is observed. It can be estimated using the `i2extras::estimate_peak()` function as shown below:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
peaks <- i2extras::estimate_peak(df_incid, progress = FALSE) %>%
  subset(select = -c(count_variable, bootstrap_peaks))
```
The rate of exponential growth or decay can be extracted from the fitted curve via `growth_rate` function.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
rates <- i2extras::growth_rate(fitted_curve)
rates <- base::as.data.frame(rates)
rates %>% select(sex, r, r_lower, r_upper)
```

### Peak time
Peak time--the date which the highest number of cases observed-- can be estimeated using the `estimate_peak` function
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
peaks <- i2extras::estimate_peak((df_incid), progress = FALSE)
peaks %>% select(-c(count_variable, bootstrap_peaks))
```

### Moving average

A moving average, which shows the trend of cases in a specified time period, can be calculated using the `add_rolling_average()` function in {i2extras} package, as illustrated below:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
moving_Avg <- i2extras::add_rolling_average(df_incid, n = 7L)
base::plot(moving_Avg, border_colour = "white", angle = 45) +
  ggplot2::geom_line(aes(x = date_index, y = rolling_average, color = "red")) +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Date", y = "Cases")
```

## Exponential growth

Within the renewal equation, the generation interval mechanistically links the reproductive number R to observables such as the epidemic growth rate r or the number of new infections per day [(Wallinga et al. 2006)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2006.3754)
