::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Get delays from a literature search database with `{epiparameter}`.
- Get distribution parameters and summary statistics of delay distributions.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: prereq

## Prerequisites

This episode requires you to be familiar with:

**Data science** : Basic programming with R.

**Epidemic theory** : Epidemiological parameters, time periods.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

The [natural history](../learners/reference.md#naturalhistory) of an infectious disease shows that its development has a regularity from stage to stage. The time periods from an infectious disease inform about the timing of transmission and interventions.

![Definition of key time periods. From [Xiang et al, 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000038)](fig/time-periods.jpg)

### Definitions

Look at the [glossary](../learners/reference.md) for the definitions of all the time periods of the figure above!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

However, early in an epidemic, modelling efforts can be delayed by the lack of a centralised resource that summarises input parameters for the disease of interest ([Nash et al., 2023](https://mrc-ide.github.io/epireview/)). Projects like `{epiparameter}` and `{epireview}` are building online catalogues following literature synthesis protocols that can help build models faster for coming outbreaks and epidemics from known pathogens and unknown ones related to known families of viruses.

<!-- Early models for COVID-19 used parameters from other coronaviruses. https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1473-3099(20)30144-4/fulltext -->

To exemplify how to use `{epiparameter}` in your analysis pipeline, our goal in this episode will be to replace the `generation_time` input that we can use for `EpiNow2::epinow()`.

```r
epinow_estimates <- epinow(
  # cases
  reported_cases = example_confirmed[1:60],
  # delays
  generation_time = generation_time_opts(generation_time),
  # computation
  stan = stan_opts(
    cores = 4, samples = 1000, chains = 3,
    control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)
  )
)
```

To do this replacement, instead of plug-in numeric values to `EpiNow2::dist_spec()` to manually specify the **summary statistics** of the delay distribution, we are going to collect them from the library of epidemiological parameters provided by `{epiparameter}`:

```r
generation_time <- dist_spec(
  mean = 3.6,
  sd = 3.1,
  max = 20,
  distribution = "lognormal"
)
```

Let's explore how we can access to time delays and get their **summary statistics** using `{epiparameter}`. We'll use the pipe `%>%` to connect some of their functions, so let's also call to the `{tidyverse}` package:

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(epiparameter)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Find a Generation time

The generation time, jointly with the $R$, can inform about the speed of spread and its feasibility of control. Given a $R>1$, with a shorter generation time, cases can appear more quickly.

![Video from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Ep 76. Science In Context - Epi Parameter Review Group with Dr Anne Cori (27-07-2023) at <https://youtu.be/VvpYHhFDIjI?si=XiUyjmSV1gKNdrrL>](fig/reproduction-generation-time.png)

In calculating the effective reproduction number ($R_{t}$), the *generation time* distribution is often approximated by the [serial interval](../learners/reference.md#serialinterval) distribution.
This frequent approximation is because it is easier to observe and measure the onset of symptoms than the onset of infectiousness.

![A schematic of the relationship of different time periods of transmission between an infector and an infectee in a transmission pair. Exposure window is defined as the time interval having viral exposure, and transmission window is defined as the time interval for onward transmission with respect to the infection time ([Chung Lau et al. 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/10/1664/6356465)).](fig/serial-interval-observed.jpeg)

However, using the *serial interval* as an approximation of the *generation time* is primarily valid for diseases in which infectiousness starts after symptom onset ([Chung Lau et al. 2021](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/224/10/1664/6356465)). In cases where infectiousness starts before symptom onset, the serial intervals can have negative values, which is the case of a pre-symptomatic transmission ([Nishiura et al. (2020)](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30119-3/fulltext#gr2)).

Additionally, even if the *generation time* and *serial interval* have the same mean, their variance usually differs, propagating bias to the $R_{t}$ estimation. $R_{t}$ estimates are sensitive not only to the mean generation time but also to the variance and form of the generation interval distribution [(Gostic et al., 2020)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409).

::::::::::::::::: callout

### From time periods to probability distributions.

When we calculate the *serial interval*, we see that not all case pairs have the same time length. We will observe this variability for any case pair and individual time period, including the [incubation period](../learners/reference.md#incubation) and [infectious period](../learners/reference.md#infectiousness).

![Serial intervals of possible case pairs in (a) COVID-19 and (b) MERS-CoV. Pairs represent a presumed infector and their presumed infectee plotted by date of symptom onset ([Althobaity et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042722000537#fig6)).](fig/serial-interval-pairs.jpg)

To summarise these data from individual and pair time periods, we can find the **statistical distributions** that best fit the data ([McFarland et al., 2023](https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2023.28.27.2200806)).

<!-- add a reference about good practices to estimate distributions -->

![Fitted serial interval distribution for (a) COVID-19 and (b) MERS-CoV based on reported transmission pairs in Saudi Arabia. We fitted three commonly used distributions, Lognormal, Gamma, and Weibull distributions, respectively ([Althobaity et al., 2022](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042722000537#fig5)).](fig/seria-interval-fitted-distributions.jpg)

Statistical distributions are summarised in terms of their **summary statistics** like the *location* (mean and percentiles) and *spread* (variance or standard deviation) of the distribution, or with their **distribution parameters** that inform about the *form* (shape and rate/scale) of the distribution. These estimated values can be reported with their **uncertainty** (95% confidence intervals).

| Gamma | mean | shape | rate/scale |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.13(13.9–14.7) | 6.31(4.88–8.52) | 0.43(0.33–0.60) |
| COVID-19 | 5.1(5.0–5.5) | 2.77(2.09–3.88) | 0.53(0.38–0.76) |

| Weibull | mean | shape | rate/scale |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.2(13.3–15.2) | 3.07(2.64–3.63) | 16.1(15.0–17.1) |
| COVID-19 | 5.2(4.6–5.9) | 1.74(1.46–2.11) | 5.83(5.08–6.67) |

| Log normal | mean | mean-log | sd-log |
|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|:--------------|
| MERS-CoV | 14.08(13.1–15.2) | 2.58(2.50–2.68) | 0.44(0.39–0.5) |
| COVID-19 | 5.2(4.2–6.5) | 1.45(1.31–1.61) | 0.63(0.54–0.74) |

### Serial interval

Assume that COVID-19 and SARS have similar reproduction number values and that the serial interval approximates the generation time. 

Given the Serial interval of both infections in the figure below: 

- Which one would be harder to control? 
- Why do you conclude that?

![Serial interval of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections overlaid with a published distribution of SARS. ([Nishiura et al, 2020](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)30119-3/fulltext))](fig/serial-interval-covid-sars.jpg)

::::::::::::::::: hint

The peak of each curve can inform you about the location of the mean of each distribution. The larger the mean, the larger the serial interval.

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution

Which one would be harder to control?

- COVID-19

Why do you conclude that?

- COVID-19 has the lowest mean serial interval. The approximate mean value for the serial interval of COVID-19 is around four days, and SARS is about seven days. Thus, COVID-19 will likely have newer generations in less time than SARS, assuming similar reproduction numbers.

The objective of the assessment above is to assess the interpretation of a larger or shorter generation time.

::::::::::::::::::::::

## Extract epidemiological parameters

First, let's assume that the data set `example_confirmed` has COVID-19 observed cases. So, we need to find a reported generation time for COVID-19 or any other useful parameter for this aim. 

Let's start by looking at how many parameters we have in the epidemiological distributions database (`epidist_db`) for the `disease` named `covid`-19:

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid"
)
```

From the `{epiparameter}` package, we can use the `epidist_db()` function to ask for any `disease` and also for a specific epidemiological distribution (`epi_dist`). 

Let's ask now how many parameters we have in the epidemiological distributions database (`epidist_db`) with the generation time using the string `generation`:

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  epi_dist = "generation"
)
```

Currently, in the library of epidemiological parameters, we have one `generation` time entry for Influenza. Considering the abovementioned considerations, we can look at the `serial` intervals for `COVID`-19. Run this locally!

```{r,eval=FALSE}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "COVID",
  epi_dist = "serial"
)
```

With this query combination, we get more than one delay distribution. This output is an object class `<multi_epidist>`.

::::::::::::::::: callout

### CASE-INSENSITIVE

`epidist_db` is [case-insensitive](https://dillionmegida.com/p/case-sensitivity-vs-case-insensitivity/#case-insensitivity). This means that you can use strings with letters in upper or lower case indistinctly.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

To summarise a `<multi_epidist>` view and get the column names from the underlying parameter dataset, we can add the `epiparameter::list_distributions()` function to the previous code using the pipe `%>%`:

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial"
) %>%
  epiparameter::list_distributions()
```

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Ebola's incubation periods

Take 5 minutes to explore the `{epiparameter}` library. 

First, search for Ebola disease delay distributions. Find:

- How many delay distributions are for the Ebola disease?

- How many types of delay distributions are for the incubation period of Ebola?

::::::::::::::::: hint

`epidist_db()` and `list_distributions()` give us different and complementary summary outputs.

The `epidist_db()` function alone counts for us the number of entries like:

- studies, and
- delay distributions.

On the other hand, the `{epiparameter}` combo of `epidist_db()` plus `list_distributions()` lists all the entries in a data frame with columns like:

- the type of the probability distribution per delay, and
- author and year of the study.

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r}
# we expect 16 delays distributions for ebola
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "ebola"
)
```

Now, from the output of `epiparameter::epidist_db()`, What is an [offspring distribution](../learners/reference.md#offspringdist)?

```{r,eval=TRUE}
# we expect 2 different types of delay distributions
# for ebola incubation period
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "ebola",
  epi_dist = "incubation"
) %>%
  list_distributions()
```

We find two types of probability distributions for this query: _lognormal_ and _gamma_.

Now, search for delay distributions of your disease of interest! Ask:

- Do you recognise the papers?

- Should it consider any other paper?

How does `{epiparameter}` do the collection and review of peer-reviewed literature? We invite you to read the vignette on ["Data Collation and Synthesis Protocol"](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter/articles/data_protocol.html)!

::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Select a single distribution

The `epiparameter::epidist_db()` function works as a filtering or subset function. Let's use the `author` argument to filter `Hiroshi Nishiura` parameters:

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Hiroshi"
) %>%
  epiparameter::list_distributions()
```

We still get more than one epidemiological parameter. We can set the `single_epidist` argument to `TRUE` to only one:

```{r}
epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "covid",
  epi_dist = "serial",
  author = "Hiroshi",
  single_epidist = TRUE
)
```

::::::::::::::::: callout

### How does `single_epidist` works?

Looking at the help documentation for `?epiparameter::epidist_db()`:

- If multiple entries match the arguments supplied and `single_epidist = TRUE`,
- Then, the parameterised`⁠<epidist>`⁠ with the largest sample size will be returned.
- If multiple entries are equal after this sorting, the first entry will be returned.

What does a parametrised `<epidist>` is? Look at `?is_parameterised`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

Now, we have an epidemiological parameter we can reuse! We can replace the **summary statistics** numbers we plug into `EpiNow2::dist_spec()`.

Let's assign this `<epidist>` class object to the `covid_serialint` object.

```{r}
covid_serialint <-
  epiparameter::epidist_db(
    disease = "covid",
    epi_dist = "serial",
    author = "Nishiura",
    single_epidist = TRUE
  )

covid_serialint
```

<!-- to activate for EpiNow2@dist-interfase

But still, we need to extract them as usable numbers. We use `epiparameter::get_parameters()` for this:

```{r}
covid_serialint_parameters <- epiparameter::get_parameters(covid_serialint)

covid_serialint_parameters
```

This gets a vector of class `<numeric>` useful as input for any other package! 

:::::::::::::::::: callout

If we write the `[]` next to the last object create like in `covid_serialint_parameters[]`, within `[]` we can use the 
Tab key <kbd>↹</kbd> 
to use the [code completion feature](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/205273297-Code-Completion-in-the-RStudio-IDE) and have a quick access to `covid_serialint_parameters["meanlog"]` and `covid_serialint_parameters["sdlog"]`. We invite you to try this out!

This only seems to work in code chunks and R console!

::::::::::::::::::

-->

## Extract the summary statistics

We can get the `mean` and standard deviation (`sd`) from this `<epidist>` diving into the `summary_stats` object:

```{r}
# get the mean
covid_serialint$summary_stats$mean
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Ebola's serial interval

Take 1 minute to:

Get access to the Ebola serial interval with the highest sample size.

Answer:

- What is the `sd` of the epidemiological distribution?

- What is the `sample_size` used in that study?

::::::::: hint

Use the `$` operator plus the <kbd>tab</kbd> or <kbd>↹</kbd>  keyboard button to explore them as an expandable list:

```r
covid_serialint$
```

Use the `str()` to display the structure of the `<epidist>` R object.

::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::: solution

```{r,eval=TRUE}
# ebola serial interval
ebola_serial <-
  epiparameter::epidist_db(
    disease = "ebola",
    epi_dist = "serial",
    single_epidist = TRUE
  )

ebola_serial
```

```{r,eval=TRUE}
# get the sd
ebola_serial$summary_stats$sd

# get the sample_size
ebola_serial$metadata$sample_size
```

Now, explore all the other nested elements within the `<epidist>` object.

Share about: 

- What elements do you find useful for your analysis?
- What other elements would you like to see in this object? How?

::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

An interesting element is the `method_assess` nested entry, which refers to the methods used by the study authors to assess for bias while estimating the serial interval distribution.

```{r}
covid_serialint$method_assess
```

We will explore these concepts at the end!

### Ebola's severity parameter

A severity parameter like the duration of hospitalisation could add to the information needed about the bed capacity in response to an outbreak ([Cori et al., 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0371)).

For Ebola: 

- What is the reported point estimate and uncertainty of the mean duration of health care and case isolation?

::::::::::::::::: hint

An informative delay should measure the time from symptom onset to recovery or death.

::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::: solution

```{r,eval=TRUE}
# one way to get the list of all the available parameters
epidist_db(disease = "all") %>%
  list_distributions() %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  distinct(epi_distribution)

ebola_severity <- epidist_db(
  disease = "ebola",
  epi_dist = "onset to discharge"
)

# point estimate
ebola_severity$summary_stats$mean
# 95% confidence intervals
ebola_severity$summary_stats$mean_ci
# limits of the confidence intervals
ebola_severity$summary_stats$mean_ci_limits
```
