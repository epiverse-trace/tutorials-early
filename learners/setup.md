## Motivation

**Outbreaks** of infectious diseases can appear as a result of different pathogens, and in different contexts, but they typically lead to similar public health questions, from understanding patterns of transmission and severity to examining the effect of control measures ([Cori et al. 2017](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0371#d1e605)). We can relate each of these public health questions to a series of outbreak data analysis tasks. The more efficiently and reliably we can perform these tasks, the faster and more accurately we can answer the underlying questions.

Epiverse-TRACE aims to provide a software ecosystem for [**outbreak analytics**](reference.md#outbreakanalytics) with integrated, generalisable and scalable community-driven software. We support the development of new R packages, help link together existing tools to make them more user-friendly, and contribute to a community of practice, spanning field epidemiologists, data scientists, lab researchers, health agency analysts, software engineers and more.

### Epiverse-TRACE tutorials

Our tutorials are built around an outbreak analysis pipeline split into three stages: **Early tasks**, **Middle tasks** and **Late tasks**. The outputs of tasks completed in earlier stages commonly feed into the tasks required for later ones.


![An overview of the tutorial topics](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/task_pipeline-minimal.svg)

Each task has its tutorial website and each tutorial website consists of a set of episodes covering different topics.

| [Early task tutorials ➠](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/) | [Middle task tutorials ➠](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-middle) | [Late task tutorials ➠](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-late/) |
|---|---|---|
| Read and clean case data, and make linelist | Real-time analysis and forecasting | Scenario modelling |
| Read, clean and validate case data, convert linelist data to incidence for visualization. | Access delay distributions and estimate transmission metrics, forecast cases, estimate severity and superspreading. | Simulate disease spread and investigate interventions. |

Each episode contains:

+ **Overview**: describes what questions will be answered and the objectives of the episode.
+ **Prerequisites**: describes what episodes/packages ideally need to be covered before the current episode.
+ **Example R code**: example R code so you can work through the episodes on your own computer.
+ **Challenges**: challenges that can be completed to test your understanding.
+ **Explainers**: boxes to enhance your understanding of mathematical and modelling concepts.

Also check out the [glossary](./reference.md) for any terms you may be unfamiliar with.

### Epiverse-TRACE R packages

Our strategy is to gradually incorporate specialised **R packages** into a traditional analysis pipeline. These packages should fill the gaps in these epidemiology-specific tasks in response to outbreaks.

![In **R**, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the **package**. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests and is easy to share with others ([Wickham and Bryan, 2023](https://r-pkgs.org/introduction.html))](episodes/fig/pkgs-hexlogos-2.png)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::: prereq

This content assumes intermediate R knowledge. This tutorials are for you if:

- You can read data into R, transform and reshape data, and make a wide variety of graphs
- You are familiar with functions from `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`, and `{ggplot2}`
- You can use the magrittr pipe `%>%` and/or native pipe `|>`.


We expect learners to have some exposure to basic Statistical, Mathematical and Epidemic theory concepts, but NOT intermediate or expert familiarity with modeling.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Software Setup

Follow these two steps:

### 1. Install or upgrade R and RStudio

R and RStudio are two separate pieces of software:

* **R** is a programming language and software used to run code written in R.
* **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier. We recommend to use RStudio to interact with R.

To install R and RStudio, follow these instructions <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Already installed?

Hold on: This is a great time to make sure your R installation is current.

This tutorial requires **R version 4.0.0 or later**.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To check if your R version is up to date:

- In RStudio your R version will be printed in [the console window](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html). Or run `sessionInfo()`.

- **To update R**, download and install the latest version from the [R project website](https://cran.rstudio.com/) for your operating system.

  - After installing a new version, you will have to reinstall all your packages with the new version.

  - For Windows, the `{installr}` package can upgrade your R version and migrate your package library.

- **To update RStudio**, open RStudio and click on
`Help > Check for Updates`. If a new version is available follow the
instructions on the screen.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

### Check for Updates regularly

While this may sound scary, it is **far more common** to run into issues due to using out-of-date versions of R or R packages. Keeping up with the latest versions of R, RStudio, and any packages you regularly use is a good practice.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### 2. Install the required R packages

<!--
During the tutorial, we will need a number of R packages. Packages contain useful R code written by other people. We will use packages from the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/).
-->

Open RStudio and **copy and paste** the following code chunk into the [console window](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html), then press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> (Windows and Linux) or <kbd>Return</kbd> (MacOS) to execute the command:

```r
# for episodes on read, clean, validate and visualize linelist

if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")

new_packages <- c(
  "cleanepi",
  "reactable",
  "rio",
  "here",
  "DBI",
  "RSQLite",
  "dbplyr",
  "linelist",
  "simulist",
  "incidence2",
  "epiverse-trace/tracetheme",
  "tidyverse"
)

pak::pkg_install(new_packages)
```

These installation steps could ask you `? Do you want to continue (Y/n)` write `Y` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### do you get an error with epiverse-trace packages?

If you get an error message when installing `{tracetheme}`, try this alternative code:

```r
# for tracetheme
install.packages("tracetheme", repos = c("https://epiverse-trace.r-universe.dev"))
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### do you get an error with other package?

Try using the classical code function to install one package, for example:

```r
install.packages("rio")
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::: spoiler

### What to do if an error persists?

If the error message keyword include an string like `Personal access token (PAT)`, you may need to [set up your GitHub token](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/git-rstudio-basics/02-setup.html#set-up-your-github-token).

First, install these R packages:

```r
if(!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")

new <- c("gh",
         "gitcreds",
         "usethis")

pak::pak(new)
```

Then, follow these three steps to [set up your GitHub token (read this step-by-step guide)](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/git-rstudio-basics/02-setup.html#set-up-your-github-token):

```r
# Generate a token
usethis::create_github_token()

# Configure your token
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()

# Get a situational report
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

Try again installing `{tracetheme}`:

```r
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/tracetheme")
```

If the error persist, [contact us](#your-questions)!

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::

You should update **all of the packages** required for the tutorial, even if you installed them relatively recently. New versions bring improvements and important bug fixes.

When the installation has finished, you can try to load the packages by pasting the following code into the console:

```r
# for episodes on read, clean, validate and visualize linelist

library(cleanepi)
library(reactable)
library(rio)
library(here)
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
library(dbplyr)
library(linelist)
library(simulist)
library(incidence2)
library(tracetheme)
library(tidyverse)
```

If you do NOT see an error like `there is no package called ‘...’` you are good to go! If you do, [contact us](#your-questions)!

### 3. Setup an RStudio project and folder

We suggest to use RStudio Projects.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: checklist

#### Follow these steps

- **Create an RStudio Project**. If needed, follow this [how-to guide on "Hello RStudio Projects"](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/get-started/#hello-rstudio-projects) to create a New Project in a New Directory.
- **Create** the `data/` folder inside the RStudio project or corresponding directory. Use the `data/` folder to **save** the data sets to download.

The directory of an RStudio Project named, for example `training`, should look like this:

```
training/
|__ data/
|__ training.Rproj
```

**RStudio Projects** allows you to use _relative file_ paths with respect to the `R` Project,
making your code more portable and less error-prone.
Avoids using `setwd()` with _absolute paths_
like `"C:/Users/MyName/WeirdPath/training/data/file.csv"`.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

### 4. Create a GitHub Account

We can use [GitHub](https://github.com) as a collaboration platform to communicate package issues and engage in [community discussions](https://github.com/orgs/epiverse-trace/discussions).

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: checklist

#### Follow all these steps

1. Go to <https://github.com> and follow the "Sign up" link at the top-right of the window.
2. Follow the instructions to create an account.
3. Verify your email address with GitHub.
<!-- 4. Configure the Multi-factor Authentication (see below).-->

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Data sets

### Download the data

We will download the data directly from R during the tutorial. However, if you are expecting problems with the network, it may be better to download the data beforehand and store it on your machine.

The data files for the tutorial can be downloaded manually here:

- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/data/ebola_cases_2.csv>
- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/data/Marburg.zip>
- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/data/simulated_ebola_2.csv>
- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/data/delta_full-messy.csv>
- <https://epiverse-trace.github.io/tutorials-early/data/linelist-date_of_birth.csv>
